### MiSTer FPGA Getting Started

For the initial set up procedure, I point to the [official guide](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Setup-Guide) :- 


After completing the SD install process, insert the SD card into the DE10-Nano board and power it up.
Ensure that an ethernet cable is attached.
Press F12 and go to the "scripts" menu
Warning asks if you want to continue, select "yes"
Select the "Update" script.

Let the process continue, it may take some time.

Once complete, all cores etc will be available and the folder structure will be set up.

The next step is to copy your roms to either the SD Card or an external drive such as USB stick or hard drive.
