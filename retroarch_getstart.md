### Retroarch Getting Started

First of all, download either the installer or the zipped version from the Retroarch website. I prefer to download the zipped version for portability.

Upon first run of Retroarch, head to the main menu and select 'Online Updater'
From there, select the options for 'Update Core Info Files' and 'Update Database'

The next step is to install a core from the 'Core Updater' option.
You will require a core for each emulated system.
Further information for specifc cores for each system can be found in the wiki pages.

The final step is to create a folder for rom files.
This can be anywhere although I prefer to keep it in the same location as teh retroarch folder.

I tend to organise my roms by system name e.g. :-
